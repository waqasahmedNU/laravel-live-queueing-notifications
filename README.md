# Laravel Queueing Notifications
### with Laravel Echo Server, Socket.IO and Redis (Queue)

Laravel Echo Server - NodeJs server for Laravel Echo broadcasting with Socket.io. [Laravel Echo Server](https://github.com/tlaverdure/laravel-echo-server).

We use Laravel Echo Server and Socket.IO for broadcasting on a particular port for Real Time Notifications. Your can further read about [Broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/broadcasting).

Redis is an in-memory data structure which store data as in-memory keyâ€“value pair. [Further Reading](https://redis.io/)

There are several ways and reasons to show notifications:
1. If you only want to show live notifcations (like the count of notifications only) we can use only Redis and set key ```count``` for storing the count of notifications. We can also store more values as key-value pair.
2. If you want to store further information about the notifcation (to show it in notificton tab) than we need to ```Create table for storing notifications data```.
